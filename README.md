# Hi, I'm Barbara Brzezińska 👋

I am a motivated professional transitioning into **Software Testing**. I recently completed the **Automation Tester Bootcamp (360h) at Kodilla**, where I gained practical experience in **manual and automated testing**, test case design and defect reporting.

Previously, I worked in **microbiological laboratories within the medical device industry**, where precision, compliance, and documentation were essential.
